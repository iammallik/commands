cd ..                                 		// Bare repos (without working directories) are typically needed for sharing.
git clone --bare hello hello.git		// Creating a bare repository.
ls hello.git					// Typically repositories ending in ‘.git’ are bare. As you can see there is no working directory in the hello.git repository. 
						// Actually it is nothing but the .git directory of a non-bare repository.	


cd hello					// To add a bare repo as a remote to our original repo.
git remote add shared ../hello.git		// Let’s add the hello.git repository to our original repository.
